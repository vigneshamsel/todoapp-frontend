## 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of our Todo application, which is built using Angular for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and deployed on AWS using CI/CD practices. It serves as a learning resource for developers looking to understand full-stack development, cloud deployment, and DevOps practices.

## 2. Architecture Overview
Our Todo app follows a microservices architecture:
- Frontend: Angular Single Page Application (SPA)
- Backend: Spring Boot RESTful API
- Database: [Your chosen database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL]
- Deployment: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
- CI/CD: [Your chosen tools, e.g., Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline]

[Include a high-level architecture diagram here]

## 3. Frontend: Angular
- Angular version: [Your version]
- Key components:
  - TodoListComponent
  - TodoItemComponent
  - TodoFormComponent
- Services:
  - TodoService (for API communication)
- State management: [If used, e.g., NgRx]
- Routing structure

Key learning points:
- Component architecture in Angular
- Services and dependency injection
- Angular forms (template-driven vs reactive)
- HTTP client for API communication

## 4. Backend: Spring Boot
- Spring Boot version: [Your version]
- Key components:
  - Controllers (e.g., TodoController)
  - Services (e.g., TodoService)
  - Repositories (e.g., TodoRepository)
- API endpoints:
  - GET /api/todos
  - POST /api/todos
  - PUT /api/todos/{id}
  - DELETE /api/todos/{id}

Key learning points:
- RESTful API design
- Spring Boot annotations
- Dependency injection in Spring
- Data persistence with Spring Data JPA

## 5. Database
- Type: [e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL]
- Schema design
- ORM: Spring Data JPA
- Migration strategy: [e.g., Flyway, Liquibase]

## 6. AWS Deployment
- Services used:
  - EC2 for backend hosting
  - S3 for static frontend hosting
  - RDS for database
  - Route 53 for DNS management
  - CloudFront for content delivery
- Infrastructure as Code: [e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform]

Key learning points:
- AWS service configuration
- Infrastructure as Code principles
- Cloud security best practices

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline
- Tools used: [e.g., Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline]
- Stages:
  1. Source control integration
  2. Build
  3. Test
  4. Deploy to staging
  5. Manual approval
  6. Deploy to production

Key learning points:
- Automated build and deployment processes
- Environment management (dev, staging, prod)
- Continuous integration practices

## 8. Testing
- Frontend: Jasmine and Karma for unit tests
- Backend: JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration tests
- E2E Testing: [e.g., Protractor, Cypress]

## 9. Security Considerations
- Authentication: [e.g., JWT, OAuth]
- HTTPS enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure coding practices

## 10. Scalability and Performance
- Load balancing with AWS ELB
- Caching strategies
- Database indexing and query optimization

## 11. Monitoring and Logging
- AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- Application performance monitoring: [e.g., New Relic, Datadog]
- Alert configuration

## 12. Future Enhancements
- Real-time updates with WebSockets
- Mobile app development
- AI-powered todo suggestions

This document serves as a starting point for understanding the Todo app's architecture and implementation. Each section can be expanded with code snippets, diagrams, and more detailed explanations as needed.
